- Use Android Studio to open and build the project.
- I removed some files from the project with gitignore, so maybe when it is opened it will warn you about missing files. Just build it.
- I tested in Android 6, but as far as I know, all the tools I used are available since Android 5. Just change this setting in the properties of the project.

- Source code for the controller is in another repository, check my github account (I do not remember its name).

Have fun.
